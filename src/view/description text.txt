      Use the options below to compile a customized NAM controller file that includes only those
      override RULs that you need.
      This will decrease the size of the controller and will make the game start up faster, but a
      deselected network cannot be built in the game. Clicking existing networks will deconvert them.
      It is however possible to play the game without the override RULs, if you do not plan to touch
      those networks.

      If nodes are disabled, this is either because you did not select the option in the installer to
      install the required resource files, like textures and paths of that network, or because the
      component is in an unreleased developmental state.
    </p>
    
    <p style="padding:5" align="justify">
      The controller file will be saved in the directory of your latest NAM installation.

        IMPORTANT! Deselecting a network or networks in the controller compiler disables the rules
        for these networks. This should be done only if you don't want to build or create additions
        to these networks in your city.
